* Make it pretty
** Colours

   It seems trivial, but it is one of the first things I do after I
   get the basics up and running. I like to get my colours and other
   basic window chrome and geegaws right.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (use-package color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow
       :ensure t
       :load-path "themes"
       :config
       (load-theme 'sanityinc-tomorrow-bright t))
   #+END_SRC

** Bars, columns and lines

   I don't want a tool bar or a scroll bar ever and I don't want a
   menu when I'm in a terminal window.  I do like the menu ot discover
   new things and keybindings when I'm using emacs as an X
   application.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; no toolbar
     (tool-bar-mode -1)

     ;; no menu in a terminal
     (unless window-system
       (menu-bar-mode -1))

     ;; no scroll bar
     ;;(scroll-bar-mode -1)

     ;; no horizontal scroll bar
     (when (boundp 'horizontal-scroll-bar-mode)
       (horizontal-scroll-bar-mode -1))
   #+END_SRC

   I also like to have an idea of where I am in the file so I'd like
   line and column numbers.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (global-linum-mode 1)
     (line-number-mode 1)
     (column-number-mode 1)
   #+END_SRC

** Startup Screen

   I'd also like to skip the startup screen and go straight to the
   *scratch* buffer.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq inhibit-startup-screen t)
   #+END_SRC
